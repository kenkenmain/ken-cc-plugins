# Phase C2.5: Fix (Targeted Patches from Judge)

Dispatch **cursor-builder** agents for targeted fixes from the judge's verdict.

## Agent

- **Type:** `minions:cursor-builder`
- **Mode:** Parallel dispatch (one per file group)

## Process

1. Read judge verdict at `.agents/tmp/phases/loop-{{LOOP}}/c3-judge.json`
2. For each issue with severity >= warning, dispatch a cursor-builder
3. Group issues by file to avoid conflicts — one builder per file group
4. After ALL fix-builders complete, aggregate into `c2.5-fixes.json`

## Prompt Template (per fix group)

```
You are a fix-builder. The judge found issues that need targeted fixes.

Issues to fix:
{{ISSUES_LIST}}

Fix ONLY these specific issues. Do not refactor, improve, or change anything else.
After fixing, commit: git add <files> && git commit -m "fix: {{brief description}}"

Write your output JSON at the end of your work.
```

## Aggregation

After all fix-builders complete, write:

`.agents/tmp/phases/loop-{{LOOP}}/c2.5-fixes.json`

```json
{
  "fixes": [
    {
      "issue_index": 0,
      "file": "src/auth.ts",
      "status": "fixed|blocked",
      "commit_sha": "abc1234",
      "description": "Added parameterized query"
    }
  ],
  "files_changed": ["src/auth.ts"],
  "all_complete": true
}
```

## Gate

Input required: `.agents/tmp/phases/loop-{{LOOP}}/c3-judge.json` with `verdict: "fix"`

Output required: `.agents/tmp/phases/loop-{{LOOP}}/c2.5-fixes.json`

Next phase: C3 (Judge re-evaluates)
